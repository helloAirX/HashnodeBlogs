# Overview of Cloud Computing


Cloud! Think of cloud as a remote location where all types of files can be stored .
Think of it as non physical entity that holds several information globally and can be accessed via a server / platform.
Now think of computing ,it's day to day operation using the computer.
Typing, accessing drives, surfing the internet and the likes are good example

Now ***cloud computing***
It is simply the delivery of computer service over the internet.

Computing services includes servers, database, storage , networking, softwares and so on. 
It offers faster innovation and flexible resources.
Some examples of cloud computing in real world scenerio are Gmail, google drive,icloud and so on. 

Cloud computing has brought about a lot of innovation, it has reduced the presence of physical servers, storage which has  brought about reduction in cost of purchase and maintenance.


**HOW CLOUD WORKS**

Cloud computing is possible because of a technology called virtualization. Virtualization allows for the creation of a simulated, digital-only "virtual" computer that behaves as if it were a physical computer with its own hardware. The technical term for such a computer is Virtual Machine


**CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE MODELS**

**PaaS**

PaaS can be compared to renting all the tools and equipment necessary for building a house, instead of renting the house itself.

In this model, companies don't pay for hosted applications; instead they pay for the things they need to build their own applications 


**SaaS**

SaaS is like renting a house: the landlord maintains the house, but the tenant mostly gets to use it as if they owned it. 
Examples of SaaS applications include Salesforce, MailChimp, Slack etc

**IaaS** 

In this model, a company rents the servers and storage they need from a cloud provider. They then use that cloud infrastructure to build their applications.
It's like a company leasing a plot of land on which they can build whatever they want â€” but they need to provide their own building equipment and materials. 
IaaS providers include DigitalOcean, Google Compute Engine, and OpenStack.

Below is a representation of the cloud models and on premises
