It was such an amazing moment leading the design team to the AWS Community day held at Lagos, Nigeria.

As a lover of design and technology, I volunteered as a designer in the AWS Community Day 2023

It was a great task having to contribute to such as amazing event which gathered over 1000 Cloud enthusiast. Aside being a cloud engineer I have design skills which I am always excited to contribute the cloud eco system.

**Highlight of the events:**

1. I led the design team in creating slides, adverts, campaigns, demonstrations and visuals that inspires and captivate the audience. It also help convey information that the audience can resonate with and these helps to break down complicated ideologies of the cloud
    
2. Aside my active participation in the design and publicity team. I also engaged in open discussion with other cloud enthusiast.
    
    With my AWS Community Cap I was a centre of attraction to many as I was able to share my experience and guide in getting into the AWS CB program.
    
3. It was also an opportunity to interact with individuals who are eager to getting started with the cloud, I was able to give guidance on the art of becoming a cloud engineer. I also encourage them to be part of the User Group where they get to meet other knowledgeable mentors who can guide them on the journey.
    
4. I also emphasized on the essence of documenting projects with blogs such as hashnode, medium etc. or make use of Git hub and not just consuming knowledge, engage actively in the User Group and network with other professionals
    

AWS Community Day is such an event that breeds creativity and lots of innovation, i look forward to it all the time.

I am excited for the opportunity to be part of something extra ordinary and i look forward to learning, growing, sharing knowledge with other AWS professionals in the community.
